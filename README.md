# framer-svgsymbols

Library that aims to make symbols exported from Sketch.app using [sketch-svgsymbols](https://github.com/gerrit/sketch-svgsymbols) usable in framer.



## TODO

- create framer layers out of overrides? ability to mark shapes as exportable (naming convention, metadata)? all children? (give framer constructor the names you want additionaly to the standard overrides)
new SVGLayer 'name', outlets: 'knob'
- import svgsymbols automatically? might need JSON index of folder
- above and/or`layers.json` support
