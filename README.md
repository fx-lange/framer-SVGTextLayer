# framer-svgsymbols

Library that aims to make symbols exported from Sketch.app using [sketch-svgsymbols](https://github.com/gerrit/sketch-svgsymbols) usable in framer.



## TODO

- fix: image replacement: first image is always inserted. rewrite ids with prefix to disambiguoate them
- create framer layers out of overrides? ability to mark shapes as exportable (naming convention, metadata)? all children? (give framer constructor the names you want additionaly to the standard overrides)
new SVGLayer 'name', outlets: 'knob'
- framer side: import svgsymbols automatically? might need JSON index of folderâ€¦
- `layers.json` support
